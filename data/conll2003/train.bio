O	Around

O	.

O	Just
O	who

O	the

O	is
O	a
O	question
O	that
O	has
O	kept
O	traders
O	and

O	guessing
O	since

O	It

O	's
B-ORG	State
I-ORG	Planning
I-ORG	Commission
O	,
O	owned
O	the

O	.

O	Traders
O	have
O	said
O	the

O	could
O	negotiate
O	concessions

O	duties
O	--
O	three
O	percent
O	import
O	tax

O	--
O	that
O	made

O	prohibitively

O	otherwise
O	.

O	But

O	source
O	,
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
B-LOC	Hong
I-LOC	Kong
O	trading
O	house
O	,
O	said
O	it
O	made
O	no

O	if

O	was

O	cleared
O	or
O	not
O	.

O	"

O	,
O	it

O	the

O	back
O	into

O	would

O	His

B-PER	Currin
O	said
O	the

O	But
B-PER	Gilbertson

O	.

O	From

B-PER	Gilbertson
O	said
O	.

O	Looking

O	to
O	the

O	,

B-PER	Gilbertson

O	in

O	Referring

O	's
O	increased
O	41.5

O	in
B-ORG	Ingwe
O	,
B-PER	Gilbertson
O	said

O	before

O	I

O	we
O	would
O	have
O	liked
O	to

O	more
O	of

O	but
O	it
O	's

O	and
O	they

O	said
B-PER	Stich
O	,
O	who
O	lost
O	the
O	1994
B-MISC	Open
O	final
O	to
B-PER	Andre
I-PER	Agassi
O	.

O	It
O	was
B-PER	Agassi
O	who
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	controversy
O	that
O	engulfed
O	the
O	tournament
O	since
O	the
O	original
O	draw
O	was
O	completed
O	on
O	Wednesday
O	.

O	The
O	flamboyant
B-MISC	American
O	star
O	was
O	bumped
O	up
O	two

O	from
O	his
B-ORG	ATP
O	ranking
O	of
O	eight
O	to
O	a
O	seeding
O	of
O	six
O	.

O	"
O	He
O	(
B-PER	Agassi
O	)
O	should
O	be
O	seeded
O	the
O	way
O	he
O	is
O	playing

O	right
O	now
O	,
O	"
O	said
B-PER	Stich
O	about
O	the
O	unfairness
O	of
O	moving
O	up
B-PER	Agassi
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	early
O	exits
O	from
O	the
B-MISC	French
I-MISC	Open
O	and
B-MISC	Wimbledon
O	.

B-PER	Stich
O	,
O	not
O	seeded
O	here
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	since
O	1990
O	,
O	might
O	have
O	benefitted
O	from
O	some
O	fiddling
O	with
O	the
O	seedings
O	himself
O	after
B-PER	Kafelnikov
O	withdrew
O	.

O	Ranked
O	18th
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
B-PER	Stich
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	slipped
O	into
O	that
O	spot
O	ahead
O	of
B-LOC	Spain
O	's
B-PER	Felix
I-PER	Mantilla
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	16th
O	but
O	had

O	and
O	had

O	But
B-PER	Stich
O	did
O	n't
O	want

O	.

O	"
O	I

O	operating

O	kept

O	insist
B-PER	Lebed
O	was
O	playing
O	for

O	that
O	the
O	proposals
O	he
O	took
O	to

O	chief-of-staff
B-PER	Aslan
I-PER	Maskhadov
O	had
O	been

B-PER	Lebed

O	,

O	have
O	profited

O	would

O	.

O	,
O	forcing

O	to
O	check
O	back
O	with
O	the
B-LOC	Kremlin
O	on
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	offer
O	.

O	A
O	rebel
O	spokesman
O	said
O	the
O	two
O	military
O	men
O	had
O	come
O	close
O	to
O	agreement
O	on
O	a
O	face-saving
O	formula
O	acceptable
O	to
O	both
O	sides
O	and
O	involving
O	a
O	referendum
O	on
O	independence
O	at
O	some
O	future
O	date
O	.

B-PER	Chernomyrdin
O	said
O	voters
O	should
O	decide
B-LOC	Chechnya
O	's
O	future
O	but
O	stressed
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	question
O	of
O	the
O	government
O	letting
O	the
O	region
O	quit
O	the
B-LOC	Russian
I-LOC	Federation
O	--
O	something

O	in

O	,
O	particularly
O	in
O	the

O	the

O	but
O	for
B-PER	Oncins
O	,
O	the

O	was

O	.

O	The

O	"
O	Two

O	Wednesday
O	approved

O	designed
O	to

O	a
O	better
O	chance
O	at
O	getting
O	the
O	best
O	price
O	available

O	were
O	proposed
O	last
O	September
O	,
O	were
O	approved

O	The

O	on

O	that

O	The

O	to
O	maintain

O	orderly
O	market
O	in
O	a

O	.

O	In
O	a
O	limit
O	order
O	,
O	investors
O	specify
O	the
O	price
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	are

O	,
O	as

O	.

O	"
O	These
O	rules
O	are
O	intended
O	to
O	empower

O	,
O	by

O	said
B-ORG	SEC
O	Chairman
B-PER	Arthur
I-PER	Levitt
O	.

O	The
B-ORG	SEC
O	's
O	goal
O	,
O	he
O	added
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	create
O	"
O	one

O	where
O	one

O	could
O	be
O	available
O	to
O	everybody
O	.
O	"

O	The
O	director
O	of
O	the
B-ORG	SEC
O	's
O	division
O	of
O	market
O	regulation
O	,
B-PER	Richard
I-PER	Lindsey
O	,
O	said
B-LOC	Wall
I-LOC	Street
O	firms
O	will
O	probably
O	need
O	to
O	spend
O	about
O	$
O	7
O	million
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	the
O	improvements
O	called
O	for
O	by
O	the
O	new
O	rules
O	.

O	In
O	proposing
O	the
O	rules
O	last
O	year
O	,
O	the
B-ORG	SEC
O	noted
O	that
O	while
O	technology
O	has
O	improved
O	,
O	commonplace
O	practices
O	still
O	existed
O	that
O	worked
O	against
O	investors
O	'
O	best
O	interests
O	.

O	It
O	noted
O	that
O	customers
O	whose
O	orders
O	were
O	not
O	displayed
O	lost
O	the
O	chance
O	of
O	getting
O	the
O	best
O	possible
O	price
O	available
O	in
O	the
O	market
O	.

O	It
O	also
O	cited
O	the
O	potential
O	problem
O	of
O	a
O	two-tiered
O	market
O	in
O	which
O	market
O	makers
O	quote
O	one
O	price
O	to
O	public
O	investors
O	while
O	quoting
O	better
O	prices
O	in
O	private
O	systems
O	,
O	thus
O	robbing
O	investors
O	without
O	access
O	to
O	"

O	quotes
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	available
O	prices
O	.

O	Earlier
O	this

O	,
O	the
B-ORG	SEC
O	settled
O	charges
O	of
O	alleged
O	malpractices
O	on

O	when
O	the

O	market
O	,
O	the
B-ORG	National
I-ORG	Association
I-ORG	of

I-ORG	Dealers
O	,
O	agreed
O	to
O	spend
O	$
O	100

O	over
O	five
O	years
O	to
O	upgrade
O	its
O	oversight
O	of
O	brokers
O	'
O	trading
O	practices
O	.

O	The
B-ORG	SEC
O	dropped
O	a
O	third
O	proposal
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	allowed
O	investors
O	with
O	market
O	orders
O	to
O	trade
O	at
O	a
O	better
O	price
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	shifts
O	in
O	prices
O	before
O	their
O	orders
O	were
O	executed
O	.

O	The
O	agency
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	monitor
O	effects
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	new
O	rules
O	before
O	considering
O	the
O	"
O	price
O	improvement
O	"
O	proposal
O	again
O	.

O	The
O	agency
O	also
O	proposed
O	rule
O	changes
O	that
O	would
O	require
O	continuous
O	"
O	bid
O	"
O	and
O	"
O	ask
O	"
O	quotations
O	from

O	specialists

O	who
O	trade
O	more
O	than
O	1
O	percent
O	of
O	a
O	stock
O	during
O	any

O	on
B-MISC	Nasdaq
O	.

O	The

O	rule
O	will
O	mean
O	a

O	for

O	,
O	where

O	have
O	never

O	The

O	friendly
O	against
B-LOC	Mexico
O	on
O	Saturday
O	at
O	the
B-LOC	Parc
I-LOC	des
I-LOC	Princes
O	.

B-PER	Pires
O	scored
O	first
O	with
O	a
O	powerful
O	shot
O	in
O	the
O	35th
O	minute
O	before
O	striking
O	again
O	from
O	close
O	range
O	just
O	before
O	the
O	break
O	.

O	A
O	solitary
O	raid
O	allowed
O	him
O	to
O	score
O	his
O	third
O	in
O	the
O	74th
O	.

B-PER	Smicer
O	's
O	goal
O	was
O	as
O	hard-won
O	as
O	his
O	team
O	's
O	victory
O	.

O	Spurred
O	by
B-PER	Foe
O	's
O	leveller
O	five
O	minutes
O	before
O	,
B-ORG	Lens
O	pressed
O	hard
O	and
B-PER	Foe
O	hit
O	the
O	crossbar
O	in
O	the
O	dying
O	seconds
O	on
O	another
O	header
O	.

O	The
O	ball
O	bounced
O	back
O	to
B-PER	Smicer
O	's
O	feet
O	and
O	he
O	scored
O	.

B-ORG	Montpellier
O	seized
O	an
O	unexpected
O	lead
O	thanks
O	to
B-PER	Kader
I-PER	Ferhaoui
O	in
O	the

O	minute
O	after
O	a
O	blunder
O	from
B-ORG	Lens
O	goalkeeper
B-PER	Jean-Claude
I-PER	Nadon
O	.

O	The
O	side
O	from

B-LOC	France
O	,
O	forced
O	to
O	fight
O	an
O	uphill
O	battle
O	from
O	then
O	on
O	,
O	pulled
O	level
O	thanks
O	to
B-PER	Tony
I-PER	Vairelles
O	in
O	the
O	eighth
O	minute
O	but
O	young
O	striker
B-PER	Fabien
I-PER	Lefevre
O	made
O	it
O	two
O	for
B-ORG	Montpellier
O	five
O	minutes
O	later
O	.

O	League
O	favourites
B-ORG	PSG
O	scored
O	a
O	convincing
O	1-0
O	win
O	over
B-ORG	Nantes
O	and
O	confirmed
O	they
O	would
O	again
O	be
O	the
O	team
O	to
O	beat
O	this
O	season
O	.

O	Ironically
O	,
B-ORG	PSG
O	's
O	victory
O	owed
O	a
O	lot
O	to
O	two
O	former
B-ORG	Nantes
O	players
O	,
O	striker
B-PER	Patrice
I-PER	Loko
O	,
O	who
O	scored

O	in
O	the
O	33rd
O	minute
O	,
O	and
O	defender
B-PER	Benoit
I-PER	Cauet
O	,
O	who
O	started
O	the
O	one-two
O	which
O	allowed
B-PER	Loko
O	to
O	score
O	.

O	The
B-MISC	Parisians
O	,
O	who
O	have
O	yet
O	to
O	concede
O	a

O	,
O	were

I-PER	Dely
I-PER	Valdes
O	,
O	both
O	called
O	up
O	by
O	their
O	national
O	sides
O	.

O	For
B-ORG	Nantes
O	,
O	who
O	shocked
B-ORG	PSG
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	league
O	crown
O	two
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	the

O	is

O	1996-08-29

O	The
B-ORG	European
I-ORG	Commission
O	said
O	on
O	Thursday
O	it
O	would
O	study
O	scientific
O	reports
O	saying
B-LOC	Britain
O	's
O	mad
O	cow
O	epidemic
O	would
O	die
O	out
O	by
O	2001
O	but
O	offered
O	little
O	prospect
O	the
O	findings
O	would
O	change
O	an
O	agreed
O	slaughter
O	campaign
O	.

O	"
O	Obviously
O	we
O	are
O	interested
O	in
O	this
O	research
O	.

O	We
O	will
O	ask
O	the
O	(
B-ORG	EU
O	)
O	scientific
O	and
O	veterinary
O	committee
O	to
O	examine
O	it
O	,
O	"
B-ORG	Commission
O	spokesman
B-PER	Gerard
I-PER	Kiely
O	told
B-ORG	Reuters
O	.

O	But
O	he
O	added
O	that
O	new
O	research
O	into
O	the
O	dynamics
O	of
O	the
O	bovine
O	spongiform
O	encephalopathy
O	(
B-MISC	BSE
O	)
O	,
O	a
O	fatal
O	brain-wasting
O	disease
O	suffered
O	by
O	cattle
O	,
O	was
O	unlikely
O	to
O	alter
O	a
O	slaughter
O	plan
O	agreed
O	by
B-LOC	Britain
O	and
O	its
O	14
B-ORG	EU
O	partners
O	.

O	"
O	We
O	agreed
O	that
O	following
O	detailed
O	scientific
O	analysis
O	using
O	a
O	methodology
O	which
O	would
O	take
O	out
O	the
O	maximum
O	number
O	of
B-MISC	BSE
O	cases
O	possible
O	.

O	I
O	think
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	difficult
O	to
O	sell
O	to
O	the
B-ORG	European
I-ORG	Commission
O	a
O	programme
O	which
O	would
O	involve
O	the
O	elimination
O	of
O	fewer
B-MISC	BSE
O	cases
O	,
O	"
B-PER	Kiely
O	said
O	.

O	"
O	We
O	will
O	look
O	at
O	our
O	approach
O	(
O	to
O	the
O	plan
O	)
O	but
O	we
O	wo
O	n't
O	get
O	involved
O	with
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	animals
O	to
O	be
O	slaughtered
O	,
O	"
O	he
O	said
O	.

O	"
O	We
O	have
O	always
O	avoided
O	the
O	question
O	of
O	numbers
O	of
O	animals
O	to
O	be
O	slaughtered
O	,
O	that
O	's
O	not
O	the
O	issue
O	.

O	The
O	issue
O	is
O	the
O	protection
O	of
O	consumers
O	'
O	health
O	and
O	the
O	rapid
O	eradication
O	of
B-MISC	BSE
O	,
O	"
O	he
O	added
O	.

O	The
O	reaction
O	is
O	likely
O	to
O	disappoint
B-MISC	British
O	farmers
O	,
O	who
O	seized
O	on
O	research
O	by
B-ORG	Oxford
O	scientists
O	in
O	the
O	scientific
O	journal
B-ORG	Nature
O	saying
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	hard
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	disease
O	any
O	faster
O	than
O	2001
O	without
O	killing
O	vast
O	numbers
O	of
O	cattle
O	.

O	The
O	researchers
O	predicted
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	340
O	new
O	infections
O	and
O	14,000
O	new
O	cases
O	of
B-MISC	BSE
O	before
O	2001
O	.

B-MISC	British
O	farmers
O	'
O	leader
O	called
O	on
O	Wednesday
O	for
O	an
O	urgent
O	meeting
O	with
O	ministers
O	to
O	discuss
O	the
O	report
O	.

O	"
O	I
O	hope
O	the
O	government
O	will
O	now
O	make
O	it
O	clear
O	they
O	believe
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	better
O	way
O	of
O	dealing
O	with
O	this
O	issue
O	,

B-ORG	National

O	president
O	Sir
B-PER	David
I-PER	Naish
O	told
B-ORG	BBC
I-ORG	radio
O	.

B-PER	Naish
O	said
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	need
O	for
B-LOC	Britain
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	a
O	planned
O	cull
O	of
O	some
O	147,000
O	cattle
O	to
O	which
O	it
O	had
O	reluctantly
O	agreed
O	to
O	placate
O	its
B-MISC	European
O	partners
O	.

O	"
O	The
O	new
O	evidence
O	to
O	me
O	means
O	some
O	of
O	that
O	proposal
O	should
O	be
O	re-examined
O	because
O	we
O	could
O	get
O	away
O	with
O	considerably
O	less
O	animals
O	being
O	culled
O	if
O	in
O	fact
O	scientists
O	throughout
B-LOC	Europe
O	accepted
O	this
O	evidence
O	,
O	"
B-PER	Naish
O	said
O	.

O	The
O	report
O	could
O	well
O	reopen
O	a
O	damaging
O	row
O	between
B-LOC	Britain
O	and
O	the
B-ORG	EU
O	,
O	which
O	slapped
O	a

O	on

O	between

O	and
O	the

O	.

O	The

O	flared
O	in

O	)
O	from

O	It
O	was

O	The

O	emerged
O	as
O	a
O	hot
O	topic
O	on
B-LOC	Wall

O	this

O	as
O	financial
O	pundits
O	debated
O	whether
B-PER	Robert

O	second
O	term
O	as
B-ORG	Treasury
O	secretary
O	if
O	President
B-PER	Clinton
O	is
O	re-elected
O	.

O	Concern
O	centred
O	on
O	the

O	since
B-PER	Rubin
O	's
O	tour
O	de
O	force
O	has
O	been
O	his
O	unflagging

O	of
O	the

O	.

O	Speculation
O	that
B-PER	Rubin
O	might
O	not
O	stay
O	in
O	his
O	post
O	grew
O	after
O	he
O	sidestepped

B-ORG	Cabinet
O	post
O	during
O	television
O	interviews
O	at
O	the
B-MISC	Democratic
O	convention
O	in
B-LOC	Chicago
O	this
O	week
O	.

O	Should
B-PER	Rubin
O	leave
O	,
B-LOC	Wall
I-LOC	Street
O	would
O	worry
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	take
O	his
O	strong-dollar
O	policy
O	with
O	him
O	.

B-PER	Rubin
O	's
O	predecessor
O	at
O	the
B-ORG	Treasury
O	,
B-PER	Lloyd
I-PER	Bentsen
O	,
O	was
O	viewed
O	with
O	suspicion
O	by
O	some
O	in
O	the
O	financial
O	markets
O	who
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	tried
O	to
O	push
O	down
O	the
O	dollar
O	to
O	gain
O	an
O	edge
O	in
O	trade
O	negotiations
O	with
B-LOC	Japan
O	.

O	"
O	Obviously
O	,
O	under
O	the
B-PER	Clinton
O	administration
O	,
O	we
O	've
O	seen
O	two
O	distinctively
O	different
O	dollar
O	policies
O	,
O	"
O	said
B-PER	Chris
I-PER	Widness
O	,
O	an
O	international
O	economist
O	at
B-ORG	Chase
I-ORG	Securities
I-ORG	Inc.
O	"
O	Under
B-PER	Rubin
O	,
O	the
B-LOC	U.S.
O	has
O	certainly
O	looked
O	for
O	a
O	strong
O	dollar
O	.
O	"

O	That
O	strategy
O	,
O	backed
O	up
O	by
O	timely
O	instances
O	of
O	joint
O	central
O	bank
O	intervention
O	,
O	helped
O	the
O	dollar
O	battle
O	back
O	from
B-MISC	post-Second
I-MISC	World
I-MISC	War
O	lows
O	of
O	1.3438
B-MISC	German
O	marks
O	on
O	March
O	8
O	,
O	1995
O	,
O	and
O	79.75
B-MISC	Japanese
O	yen
O	on
O	April
O	19
O	,
O	1995
O	.

O	Currently
O	,
O	the
O	dollar
O	stands
O	at
O	about
O	1.48
O	marks
O	and
O	109
O	yen
O	.

B-PER	Rubin
O	was
O	widely
O	hailed
O	as
O	the
O	architect
O	of
O	the
O	dollar
O	's
O	comeback
O	,
O	using
O	skills
O	and
O	expertise
O	gained
O	in
O	26
O	years
O	on
B-LOC	Wall

O	,
O	part

O	a

O	at
B-ORG	Bailard
I-ORG	,
I-ORG	Biehl

O	just

O	$
O	1

O	.

O	"
O	Anyone
O	who
O	would
O	come
O	in
O	there
O	to
O	replace
O	him
O	would
O	have
O	awfully
O	big

O	"

O	Fear
O	that
O	a
O	new
B-ORG	Treasury
O	secretary
O	might
O	favour
O	a
O	return
O	to
B-MISC	Bentsen-era
O	policy
O	could
O	spell
O	trouble
O	for
O	financial
O	markets
O	.

O	Some
O	overseas
O	investors
O	might
O	shy
O	away
O	from
O	buying
B-LOC	U.S.
O	stocks
O	and
O	bonds
O	or
O	even
O	sell
O	them
O	when
O	the
O	dollar
O	is
O	weakening
O	.

O	As
O	for
B-ORG	U.S.
I-ORG	Treasury
O	securities
O	,
B-PER	Widness
O	explained
O	that
B-PER	Alan
I-PER	Greenspan
O	's
O	reappointment
O	as
O	chairman
O	of
O	the
B-ORG	Federal
I-ORG	Reserve
O	and
O	the
O	outlook
O	for
O	the
O	federal
O	budget
O	were
O	more
O	important
O	than
O	whether
B-PER	Rubin
O	continues
O	at
O	the
B-ORG	Treasury
O	.

O	"
O	Although
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	did
O	get
O	someone
O	that
O	was
O	seen
O	as
O	looking
O	for
O	a
O	dollar
O	depreciation
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	probably
O	hurt
O	capital
O	flows
O	to
O	the
B-LOC	United
I-LOC	States
O	,
O	"
O	said
B-PER	Widness
O	,
O	adding
O	that
O	could
O	hurt
B-LOC	U.S.
O	stocks
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	a
O	lesser
O	degree
O	,
O	bonds
O	.

O	Still
O	,
O	markets
O	may
O	have
O	little
O	to
O	fear
O	from
O	any
B-PER	Rubin
O	successor
O	because
O	the
O	firm
O	dollar
O	policy
O	has
O	yielded
O	positive
O	results
O	.

O	If
O	that
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	then
O	any
O	new
B-ORG	Treasury
O	chief
O	would
O	need
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	effective
O	as
B-PER	Rubin
O	in
O	convincing
O	markets
O	that
O	the
B-LOC	White
I-LOC	House
O	does
O	indeed
O	want
O	a
O	strong
O	currency
O	.

O	"
O	If
O	he
O	left
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	question
O	people
O	would
O	ask
O	the
O	next
O	guy
O	is
O	,
O	'
O	What
O	's
O	your
O	view
O	on
O	the
O	dollar

O	.

O	And
O	all
O	I
O	can
O	say
