O	He

B-PER	Van
I-PER	Boxmeer
O	said
O	the

O	had
O	prevented

O	from
O	raising

O	with

O	.

O	He

O	would
O	also
O	increase
O	in
O	the

O	for

O	.

O	But
O	he

O	$
O	100
O	million
O	already
O	this

O	with
O	such

O	as

O	from

O	Some

O	says
O	such

O	might
O	be
O	exaggerated
O	despite
O	the
B-LOC	Czech

O	market
O	's
O	overcapacity
O	.

O	"
O	I
O	think
B-MISC	Polish

O	.

B-PER	Van

O	said
B-ORG	Zywiec
O	had
O	its

O	said
O	it
O	would

O	,
O	but
O	that
B-ORG	Zywiec
O	's
O	potential

O	was
O	a
O	medium-term
O	possibility
O	rather
O	than
O	a

O	.

O	He
O	said
O	his

O	would
O	be

O	off
O	concentrating

B-PER	Young

O	If

O	,
O	then
O	we

O	probably

O	using
